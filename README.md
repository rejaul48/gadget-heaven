## React Concepts Used in GadgetHaven

**Component-Based Architecture:** The entire project is structured with reusable, modular components such as Navbar, ProductList, ProductCard, and Cart. This modular approach makes it easy to manage, extend, and maintain the codebase as the project grows.<br>

**Context API for Global State Management:** The Context API handles the cart and wishlist states, making this data accessible across the app without needing to pass props deeply. This provides a smooth and consistent shopping experience across different parts of the site.<br>

**State and Event Handling:** useState and event handlers control dynamic interactions, like adding/removing products from the cart, updating wishlist items, and handling user actions on the product filtering and sorting functions.<br>

**React Router for Navigation:** React Router enables multi-page functionality with routes for the homepage, product details, cart, wishlist, and error pages, providing a seamless and intuitive navigation experience across the site.<br>

**Conditional Rendering:** Conditional rendering is used to control UI based on the application state, like displaying "Empty Cart" when the cart has no items or showing filtered products based on user selections.<br>


## Data Management Strategy in GadgetHaven

**The Context API** is used to manage the shopping cart and wishlist states globally across the application. By setting up a central context for these features, components throughout the app can easily access and update the cart and wishlist without prop drilling.<br>

This approach ensures that the cart and wishlist states are consistent and synchronized, providing a smooth experience as users add or remove items.<br>
